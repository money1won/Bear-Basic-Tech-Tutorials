# If statements are used to control actions to be performed given if a certain conditional statement is true or not

# SYNTAX
#  if [conditional statement]:
    # [do stuff]

# Simple example

y = 1
x = 3

if y == 1:
    print("do stuff 1")

if x == 3:
    print("do stuff 2")












# Elif statements are used when you want only one condition to be fired. The first statement that presents a true
# conditional will be the one that is fired

# All elif statements MUST be preceded by an if statement

# SYNTAX
# [if statement]
    # [do stuff]
# elif [conditional statement]:
    # [do stuff]

# simple example

# x = 5
#
# if x == 1:
#     print("x is 1")
# elif x <= 4:
#     print("x is less than or equal to 4")
# elif x <= 5:
#     print("x is less than or equal to 5")

# How this is different from "if"

# x = 1
# if x == 1:
#     print("x is 1")
# if x <= 4:
#     print("x is less than or equal to 4")
# if x <= 5:
#     print("x is less than or equal to 5")








# Else statements are general statements that will be last to fire in an if/elif statement stack. Not mandatory,
# but act as a good catch-all to ensure the stack does something at least, even if no conditions in the stack are met

# MUST be preceded by at least an if statement. Does not necessarily have elif statements preceding them, but could

# SYNTAX
# [if statement]
    # [do stuff]
# [any elif statements]
    # [do stuff]
# else:
    # [do stuff]


# simple example

# x = 56716
# 
# if x == 1:
#     print("x is 1")
# elif x <= 4:
#     print("x is less than or equal to 4")
# else:
#     print("no conditionals were true")
