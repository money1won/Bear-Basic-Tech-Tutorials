# 1. Numbers
# Integer
int_variable = 4
# Float
float_variable = 3.32
# Complex
complex_variable = 3+4j
complex_variable2 = complex(3,4)

print(int_variable)
print(float_variable)
print(complex_variable)
print(complex_variable2)















# 2. String
str_variable = "Hello World"
variable2 = 2

# Printing a string
# print(variable2)

# convert an int to a string
# str_variable2 = str(2)

# Printing a string with an int
# print(str_variable + str_variable2)

















# 3. Tuple
# Tuples can store multiple data types similar to a list. Tuples however are immutable, meaning the values in the
# tuple cannot be modified. You cannot modify the size of the tuple either
tuple_variable = ("test", 1, 2.34, "z")

# Attempt to assign a tuple after it is made
# tuple_variable[0] = "not test"

# Print the tuple's first item
# print(tuple_variable[0])

# Print the whole tuple
# print(tuple_variable)

# Note: Main reason to use these is to defend this variable from any changes while the program is run


















# 4. List
# Lists can store multiple different types of elements like the tuple. However this data type is mutable, meaning
# you can edit the values of whatever is stored inside the list or even the size of the list
list_variable = ["test", 1, 2.34, "z"]

# Assign a new value to a list item
# list_variable[0] = 3

# Add to a list
# list_variable.append("4")

# Print the list
# print(list_variable)















# 5. Set
# Sets themselves are mutable, but their variables are not. The set is not ordered and will be different everytim the
# set is created. You cannot change items, but you can remove items and add new items. Keep in mind, no duplicates are
# allowed in sets and will be ignored
set_variable = {"test", 1, 2.34, "z"}

# Attempt to assign the set item a new value
# set_variable[0] = 4

# Print the set
# print(set_variable)


# used well when trying to get rid of duplicates
# duplicate_list = ["1", "1", "1", "2", "2", "3", "7"]
# set_list = set(duplicate_list)

# print(duplicate_list)
# print(set_list)
# duplicate_list = list(set_list)
# print(duplicate_list)















# print(tuple_variable)
# print(list_variable)
# print(set_variable)
















# 6. Dictionary
dictionary_variable = {"item" : "money",
                       "quantity" : 100,
                       "extra items": ["wallet", "hat"]}


print(dictionary_variable["item"])  # outputs "money"
print(dictionary_variable["quantity"])  # outputs 100
print(dictionary_variable["extra items"])  # outputs "wallet" and "hat" as a list

# Note: Useful if you want a list like variable that can use "keys" to map to variables instead of index values
