# For loops tutorial
# For loops iterate over a provided sequence (lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, strings)

# Iterates through 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 (for a total of 5 times in this case)

# Built with 4 main components:
# FOR keyword; Variable that will hold the iterating value; IN keyword; your sequence

for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)





















some_list = [432, 431, 51, 1511, 51]

# for i in (some_list):
#     print(i)


# for i in range(some_list):
#     print(i)


# for i in range(len(some_list)):
#     print(i)


# for i in enumerate(some_list):
#     print(i)

#
# for i in enumerate(some_list):
#     i = i[0]
#     print(i)
















# Useful when dealing with large or dynamic data sets
# EX. updated a list of values with an unknown length

my_list = [1] * 1000

# for i in enumerate(my_list):
#     print(i)


# EX. Find how many "s" are in the sentence
sentence = "someone really likes to spin their wheels in python tutorials"
count = 0

for i in sentence:
    if i == "s":
        count += 1

# print("Python found " + str(count) + " S's in the sentence!")
