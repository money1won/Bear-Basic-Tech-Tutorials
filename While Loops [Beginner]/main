# while loops

# While loops allow a programmer to continuously run through commands while a certain condition is being met


# PYTHON SYNTAX:
# while (boolean expression) :

# Basic example

x = 1
while x == 1:
    print(x)
    x += 1
    print(x)


# Similar to a For loop (equivalent to iterating from 1-4

# x = 1
# while x < 5:
#     print(x)
#     x += 1
#     print(x)










# Use of break statement

# x = 1
# while x < 8:
#     print(x)
#     x += 1
#     if x == 5:
#         break

















# Be careful! If a while loop condition is incorrectly written where it is always true, it can create an "infinite loop"

# x = 1
# while x < 9:
#     y = x + 1
#     x += 1
#     print("y = " + str(y))
#     print("x = " + str(x))
